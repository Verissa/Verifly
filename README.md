VERIFLY: A DRONE-SUPPORTED FIRST AID SYSTEM FOR ASHESI UNIVERSITY 

Verifly is a system that is made up of mobile applications and a drone. 
The system is built to help with administering emergency care to injured people on the Ashesi University campus. 
Injured persons can request for first aid using a mobile application. 
This request initiates a first aid kit equipped droneâ€™s flight to the request location and a first aid guideline display on the Android mobile application. 
Secondary users, the health center personnel, interact with a mobile application to view requests and create chart-based reports. 
Administrators can also automate the drone flight using the Android mobile application.
